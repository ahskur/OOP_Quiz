Day 17 of 100 Days of Code Challenge
This was probably the hardest one yet - Or at least the one I've really had a hard time figuring it out.


Defining functions inside Classes (a.k.a. methods) and attributes was not that troubling but getting the inputs that the objects can receive was like building a little machine that needs to always have its parts working towards the same goal... If that even makes sense.


It was really interesting to see actual differences from when you're procedural coding and OOP - The goal is always to write Classes that can also be reused and not just one-off-and-done and this was also a challenge...


I guess the takeaways are:
- Write simple but effective code
- Keep the code organized and try to use a naming structure that makes sense and can be "self-explanatory"
- OOP = reusable in similar contexts
